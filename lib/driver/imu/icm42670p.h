/**
 * @file icm42670p.h
 * @brief Driver for the ICM-42670-P IMU sensor.
 * 
 * This driver provides functionality to initialize the ICM-42670-P IMU sensor,
 * read sensor data, and configure the sensor settings.
 * 
 * The entry point for this module is the `ICM42670P` class, which handles
 * communication with the sensor over I2C. The class constructor initializes
 * the sensor and sets it up for operation, while the destructor cleans up
 * the file descriptor used for I2C communication. The class also provides
 * methods to write to and read from specific registers of the sensor, which
 * enables reading sensor data such as temperature, accelerometer, and
 * gyroscope values.
 * 
 * This driver is designed to be used in a Linux environment with I2C support.
 * @see https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/icm-42670-p-datasheet/
